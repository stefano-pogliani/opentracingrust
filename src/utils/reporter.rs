/// The reporter spawns a thread that loops until stopped and waits for `FinishedSpan`s.
/// Every time a finished span is received the `ReporterFn` closure is called with it.
/// The `ReporterFn` closure is responsible for shipping the received spans.
///
/// The `ReporterThread` also supports clean shutdown of the receiver thread.
/// When `ReporterThread::stop` is called or an instance is dropped:
///
///   1. The calling thread is paused for the `stop_delay` duration.
///      This allows the reporter thread to process any `FinishedSpan`s still in the channel.
///   2. The background thread is informend to shutdown and the calling thread joins it.
///   3. As soon as any `FinishedSpan` is processed or receiving times out the thread is stopped.
///      Receiving spans times out every 50 milliseconds.
// If https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27800 leads to a stable API
// rework this to be more efficient with shutdowns.
